- improve error handling in express (merge conditional)
- greatly improve JWT Tokens functionality from prev commit:
  on successful login/register:
    a. gen access and refresh token 
    b. save refresh token to redis with no expiration
    c. save access and refresh token in front localstorage instead of cookies - see 'help-me-out!' branch
    d. when a reqeust fails due to an expired access token, we do the following:
      1. return 'token expired' to front
      2. make a /refresh-access-token request and include the localStorage refresh token
        - verify refresh token against the one in Redis
        - Delete previous refresh token
        - gen a new access and refresh token
        - Return both tokens to server.ts
      3. if instruction 2 went well, store new access and refresh token in front localStorage
      4. repeat original request with the new access token
- create react context to store vacations and user in a centralized manner
