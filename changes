- Improve context: remove user state, replace role with ref and add a userId ref
- Update delete function since the keys in vacation and users table are linked as foreign links to the followers table

It's a good opportunity to mention that certain compromises are made throughout the project to improve performance, save time and most notably, 
simplify the code, over maintaining high security and privacy standards. This is a small project, so IMO those sacrifices are acceptable.
Exmaples:
  Included both refs in the context although they are rarely used in the project - improve readability and make the project easier to expand
  Provide a copy of the isUserFollowingVacation instead of moving the func to a seperate file
  Updating the UI by a refresh, although a smoother approach would be repeating the fetch vacations request manually
